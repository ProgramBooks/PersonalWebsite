      The Basics

    <p>
      My name is Lily Thomas. I am 16 years old. I am a rising junior, and have been homeschooled my whole life. I like math and reading.
If I could read a new book every day I would. I have four older sisters who I look up to and admire. I have lived in Kennedale Texas
my whole life. My favorite thing about computers is that you can do anything with a computer. The possibilities are endless. I want
my life to be a little like a computer. I never want to limit myself. I want to do things no one thought I could.

      I love to read, dance, and bake. I love reading because books are so helpful for me when I am struggling to understand a consept.
