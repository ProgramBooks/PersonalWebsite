        The Basics
      </h2>
      <p>
        My name is Lily Thomas. I am 16 years old. I am a rising junior, and
        have been homeschooled my whole life. I like math and reading. If I
        could read a new book every day I would. I have four older sisters who I
        look up to and admire. I have lived in Kennedale Texas my whole life. My
        favorite thing about computers is that you can do anything with a
        computer. The possibilities are endless. I want my life to be a little
        like a computer. I never want to limit myself. I want to do things no
        one thought I could.

      Hobbies
    </h2>
    <p>
      I love to read, dance, and bake. I love reading because books help me
      understand my world. While some people might fail to see the similarity
      between Harry Potter's Hogwarts and Fort Worth Texas, I find that
      characters and fantasy lands have the ability to take complex world issues
      and break them down to simple elements. I also love diving into a
      intriguing story when I feel stressed about things in my life. I love to
      dance because dancing gives me the ability to express myself by moving
      around and it doesn't have to be graceful to be amazing. I love the
      simplicity and completity of dancing. While those may seem to conflict
      each other, I find that they actually compliment each other in dance.
      Baking is an art and a tasty way to express yourself. I love the
      challanges of baking and I love that it isn't as hard as most people think
      it is. Anyone can learn to bake and there is something for everyone to
      enjoy in baking.
