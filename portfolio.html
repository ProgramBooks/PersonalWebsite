        My Programming Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        I was first introduced to computer programming through a Khan Academy
        program my mom made me take in school. I was convinced I would hate
        programming, but I started doing the course, because I had to. And I
        loved it. Every morning, I started my school day with my assigned coding
        for the day. I didn't think much of how I enjoyed the program, until
        christmas break when my sister and mom started talking about how I loved
        coding and it could be something I could do for a job. That was in 8th
        grade. I have been programming and learning about women in tech ever
        since.
